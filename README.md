# Gangsta-s-paradise
lyrics
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
i take a look at my life and realise thiers noyhin left<br>
cause i have been blastin and laughin so long that<br>
even my momma thinks that my mind is gone<br>
but i aint never crossed a man that didnt deserve it <br>
me be treated like a punk you know unheard off<br>
you better watch how you talkin and where you walkin<br>
or you and your hommies might be lined in challk<br>
i realy hate to trip but i got loc<br>
as they crok i see myself in the pistul smoke<br>
fool im the kinda G the littele hommies wanna be like <br>
on my nees in the night sayin preyaers in the streetlight<br>
beeen spendin most there lives <br>
living in a gangsta paradise<br>
beeen spendin most there lives <br>
living in a gangsta paradise<br>
keep spendin most our lives <br>
living in a gangsta paradise<br>
keep spendin most our lives <br>
living in a gangsta paradise<br>
